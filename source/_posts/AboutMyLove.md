True treasure is usually hidden in a inconspicuous corner ...

So here it goes my life with little bit pieces of interesting moments with my lovely wife, markdown the most valuable moment in this little corner of my learning way.

- One very similar thing for both of us is that we have a mind with thousands of ideas and imagination. But she is even much more than me. "A person with rich spirit world never feels lonely", said she. Right in the moment when she is taking shower, I can clearly hear her saying things to herself, "bra bra bra", learning Swedish isn't that terrible right?
